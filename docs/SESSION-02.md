# Session 02 - Phase 2 Implementation: Upload & Processing

**Date**: August 17, 2025  
**Phase**: Phase 2 - Upload & Processing  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

## Phase 2 Objectives (from PLAN.md)
1. ✅ Configure FilePond for 100MB PDF uploads
2. ✅ Implement upload with progress tracking (direct to n8n webhook)
3. ✅ Integrate n8n webhook API calls with proper timeouts
4. ✅ Add comprehensive error handling and retry logic

## Implementation Strategy

### File Upload Approach: Direct Upload to n8n Webhook
**Decision**: Upload complete PDF directly to n8n webhook (no intermediate chunking server)

**Rationale**:
- Aligns with simple architecture: `[React App] → [FilePond Upload] → [n8n Webhook]`
- n8n webhooks on Railway can handle 100MB files reliably
- FilePond provides excellent UX without requiring true chunking
- Avoids additional infrastructure complexity
- Mistral OCR API needs complete PDF for proper document context

### Technical Specifications

**n8n Webhook Integration**:
- **URL**: `https://primary-production-6654.up.railway.app/webhook/9d000de0-872a-4443-9c57-b339fc8ef60c`
- **Method**: POST with `multipart/form-data`
- **Field Name**: `data` (as expected by n8n workflow)
- **Timeout**: 10 minutes (600,000ms) for OCR processing
- **Response**: Plain text (cleaned markdown)

**Error Handling Strategy**:
- **Upload Failures**: FilePond validation errors, network issues, file size/type
- **Processing Failures**: n8n workflow errors, Mistral API failures, timeouts
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff (immediate, 2s, 8s, 30s) with user control
- **User Experience**: Clear error messages, manual retry options, progress preservation

## Detailed Implementation Plan

### Step 1: API Service (src/services/api.ts)
**Objectives**:
- Direct FormData upload to n8n webhook
- 10-minute timeout configuration
- Error classification and response parsing
- Retry mechanism with exponential backoff

**Key Features**:
- AbortController for request cancellation
- Proper error handling for different failure types
- Response validation and parsing

### Step 2: Error Handling Utilities (src/utils/errorHandling.ts)
**Objectives**:
- Error classification system
- User-friendly error messages
- Retry logic implementation
- Recovery suggestions

**Error Categories**:
- **Validation Errors**: File size, type, corrupted files
- **Network Errors**: Connection issues, timeouts
- **Server Errors**: n8n webhook failures, processing errors
- **Processing Errors**: Mistral API failures, workflow execution issues

### Step 3: Processing State Hook (src/hooks/useOCRProcessing.ts)
**Objectives**:
- State management for upload → processing → complete flow
- Progress tracking and user feedback
- Error state management and retry coordination
- File state preservation during retries

**Processing States**:
- `idle`: Ready for file upload
- `uploading`: File upload in progress
- `processing`: OCR processing via n8n workflow
- `completed`: Successfully processed with results
- `error`: Failed with error details and retry options

### Step 4: Processing States Component (src/components/ProcessingStates.tsx)
**Objectives**:
- Visual feedback for all processing stages
- Upload progress indicators
- OCR processing spinner with time estimates
- Error displays with retry buttons
- Success animations and result preview

**UI Elements**:
- Progress bars for upload
- Spinner with estimated time for OCR processing
- Error messages with retry buttons
- Success state with result preview

### Step 5: Enhanced FileUpload Component
**Objectives**:
- Integrate with processing hooks
- Configure FilePond for direct webhook upload
- Handle all processing states
- Provide comprehensive user feedback

**Updates**:
- FilePond server configuration for direct upload
- Processing state integration
- Error handling and retry UI
- Progress tracking and user feedback

### Step 6: App Integration
**Objectives**:
- Wire up complete upload → processing → result flow
- State management across components
- Testing with various file sizes and error scenarios

## Files to Create/Modify

### New Files:
- `docs/SESSION-02.md` ✅
- `src/services/api.ts` ✅
- `src/utils/errorHandling.ts` ✅
- `src/hooks/useOCRProcessing.ts` ✅
- `src/components/ProcessingStates.tsx` ✅

### Modified Files:
- `src/components/FileUpload.tsx` - ✅ Enhanced with processing integration
- `src/App.tsx` - ✅ Complete processing flow integration
- `src/types/index.ts` - ✅ Additional type definitions added

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Upload 100MB PDFs reliably to n8n webhook
- ✅ Visual progress tracking during upload and processing
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- ✅ Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- ✅ Manual retry and recovery options
- ✅ Processing time under 5 minutes for typical PDFs
- ✅ Clean integration with existing FilePond setup

## Technical Implementation Details

### FilePond Configuration
```javascript
// Direct upload to n8n webhook
server: {
  url: 'https://primary-production-6654.up.railway.app',
  process: {
    url: '/webhook/9d000de0-872a-4443-9c57-b339fc8ef60c',
    method: 'POST',
    timeout: 600000, // 10 minutes
    onload: (response) => response,
    onerror: (response) => response
  }
}
```

### Error Handling Flow
1. **Client-side validation** (file type, size) - immediate feedback
2. **Upload errors** (network, server) - retry with exponential backoff
3. **Processing errors** (OCR failures) - clear messages with restart option
4. **Timeout handling** - graceful degradation with retry options

### Processing State Management
```javascript
const states = {
  idle: 'Ready for upload',
  uploading: 'Uploading PDF...',
  processing: 'Processing with OCR (2-5 min)...',
  completed: 'Processing complete!',
  error: 'Error occurred - retry available'
}
```

## Next Phase Preview
Once Phase 2 is complete, Phase 3 will implement:
- PDF viewer with react-pdf
- Text output component for OCR results
- Side-by-side comparison layout
- Synchronized scrolling between PDF and text

## Issues Discovered During Testing

### 🐛 Bug: "Process Another File" Re-processes Same File

**Issue Description:**
When user clicks "Process Another File" button after successful OCR processing, instead of allowing a new file upload, the system automatically re-processes the previously uploaded file.

**Root Cause Analysis:**
1. **State Management Mismatch**: Two separate state systems managing file selection
   - `selectedFile` state in FileUpload component (src/components/FileUpload.tsx:20)
   - `state.file` in useOCRProcessing hook (src/hooks/useOCRProcessing.ts)

2. **Reset Logic Gap**: `onReset` function only clears OCR processing state
   - ProcessingStates.tsx:89 calls `onReset` 
   - useOCRProcessing.ts:169 `reset()` only clears processing state
   - FileUpload component's `selectedFile` remains set to previous file

3. **Auto-Processing Trigger**: useEffect in FileUpload re-triggers processing
   - FileUpload.tsx:54-58 auto-starts processing when `selectedFile` exists and status is 'idle'
   - After reset, status becomes 'idle' but `selectedFile` still contains previous file

**Technical Details:**
```typescript
// Problem flow:
// 1. User uploads file → selectedFile = file1, processing completes
// 2. User clicks "Process Another File" → onReset() called
// 3. OCR state resets to 'idle', but selectedFile still = file1  
// 4. useEffect triggers: if (selectedFile && state.status === 'idle') 
// 5. processFile(selectedFile) called with file1 again
```

**Impact:** Poor user experience, confusion, prevents new file uploads

## Bug Fix Implementation Plan

### TODO List:
1. ✅ Log bug in SESSION-02.md with technical analysis
2. ✅ Update useOCRProcessing hook to support external state clearing callback
3. ✅ Modify FileUpload component to clear selectedFile on reset
4. ✅ Add FilePond ref to programmatically clear its state
5. ✅ Test complete user flow end-to-end

### Fix Implementation:

**useOCRProcessing Hook Changes:**
- Added `onReset?: () => void` callback to OCRProcessingOptions interface
- Modified `reset()` function to call `options.onReset?.()` after clearing state

**FileUpload Component Changes:**
- Added `filePondRef` using `useRef<FilePond>(null)`
- Created `handleReset()` function to clear both `selectedFile` state and FilePond files
- Connected `handleReset` to `onReset` callback in useOCRProcessing options
- Added `ref={filePondRef}` to FilePond component

**Result:**
- "Process Another File" button now properly resets UI to empty upload state
- FilePond component clears and shows upload area
- No auto-processing of previous file occurs
- User can select and process new files correctly

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

## Next Steps (Phase 3)
With Phase 2 complete and bug fixes implemented, the foundation is ready for Phase 3 implementation:
1. PDF viewer component with react-pdf
2. Text output component for OCR results  
3. Side-by-side comparison layout
4. Synchronized scrolling between PDF and text
