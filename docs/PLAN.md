# OCR App Development Plan

## Project Overview
Build a React frontend for PDF OCR processing with side-by-side comparison of original PDF and extracted text using the existing n8n workflow (ID: dMziNH2R1VZzGwyB). Designed specifically for image-heavy, complex layout PDFs that require OCR processing.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components
- **File Upload**: FilePond (chunked uploads for 100MB files)
- **PDF Rendering**: react-pdf (visual fidelity for complex layouts)
- **HTTP**: fetch API with timeout and retry logic
- **Export**: Google Docs API integration
- **Deployment**: Vercel (free tier, zero-config)

## Architecture & Data Flow
```
[React App] → [FilePond Upload] → [n8n Webhook] → [Mistral OCR] → [Cleaned Text Response]
     ↓                                                                    ↓
[react-pdf Viewer]  ←→  [Side-by-side Layout]  ←→  [Text Display + Export]
```

## Core Features

### 1. File Upload Interface (FilePond)
- **Chunked uploads** for 100MB image-heavy PDFs
- Built-in progress tracking with bandwidth estimation
- Automatic retry on failed chunks
- PDF validation (type + 100MB size limit)
- Professional drag-and-drop experience
- File preview thumbnails

### 2. PDF Viewer (Left Side - react-pdf)
- **Visual rendering** preserving exact original layout
- Perfect for scanned documents and image-heavy PDFs
- Page navigation with thumbnail sidebar
- Zoom controls (25% to 500%)
- Full-screen mode for detailed inspection
- Canvas-based rendering for complex graphics

### 3. Text Output (Right Side)
- Markdown rendering of OCR results from Mistral AI
- Syntax highlighting for better readability
- Copy-to-clipboard functionality
- Export to Google Docs button
- Text search within results
- Word count and processing statistics

### 4. Processing States & UX
- FilePond upload progress with chunk visualization
- OCR processing spinner with estimated time (2-5 minutes)
- Real-time status updates during workflow execution
- Error handling with automatic retry options
- Success animations and processing summaries

### 5. Side-by-Side Comparison
- **Synchronized scrolling** between PDF pages and text sections
- Responsive layout (stacked on mobile, side-by-side on desktop)

## Technical Integration

### FilePond Configuration
- **Chunk Size**: 5MB for optimal upload performance
- **Max File Size**: 100MB
- **File Types**: PDF only
- **Retry Logic**: 3 attempts per chunk
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time bandwidth calculation

### react-pdf Setup
- **Worker Path**: ✅ Proper PDF.js worker configuration (version 5.3.93 compatibility)
- **Canvas Rendering**: For complex layout preservation
- **Memory Management**: Efficient page caching
- **Error Handling**: Fallback for corrupted PDFs

### n8n Webhook Integration
- **Endpoint**: `https://primary-production-6654.up.railway.app/webhook/9d000de0-872a-4443-9c57-b339fc8ef60c`
- **Method**: POST with multipart/form-data
- **Timeout**: 10 minutes (for large OCR processing)
- **Retry Strategy**: Exponential backoff with user feedback

### Error Handling Strategy
- **Upload Failures**: FilePond automatic chunk retry
- **Network Issues**: Comprehensive retry logic with user control
- **OCR Failures**: Clear error messages with workflow restart
- **PDF Rendering**: Graceful fallback for unsupported features

## Performance Considerations
- **Large File Handling**: FilePond chunked uploads prevent browser timeouts
- **PDF Rendering**: Lazy loading of pages and efficient canvas management
- **Memory Usage**: Proper cleanup of PDF.js workers and canvas elements
- **Mobile Performance**: Optimized rendering for touch devices

## Library Justification

### FilePond vs react-dropzone
**FilePond chosen because:**
- Built-in chunked uploads essential for 100MB files
- Professional progress tracking for long uploads
- Robust error handling and automatic retry
- Better UX for large file uploads

### react-pdf for Complex PDFs
**Perfect for image-heavy, non-text PDFs because:**
- Visual rendering preserves exact original appearance
- No dependency on extractable text (ideal for scanned docs)
- Canvas-based rendering handles complex graphics
- Maintains fidelity for accurate comparison with OCR output

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Upload 100MB image-heavy PDFs reliably
- ✅ Visual comparison between original PDF and OCR text
- ✅ Handle scanned documents and complex layouts
- ✅ Export clean text to Google Docs
- ✅ Mobile-responsive design
- ✅ Processing time under 5 minutes for typical PDFs
- ✅ Robust error handling for network/processing failures

This plan specifically addresses the challenges of processing image-heavy, complex PDFs that require OCR rather than simple text extraction.

## Recent Updates & Fixes

### Phase 3 Implementation Complete (August 17, 2025)
**Achievement:** Full side-by-side PDF and text comparison interface successfully implemented

**Components Delivered:**
- ✅ PDFViewer.tsx - Canvas-based PDF rendering with navigation and zoom
- ✅ TextOutput.tsx - Markdown rendering with search and copy functionality
- ✅ ComparisonView.tsx - Resizable side-by-side layout with responsive design
- ✅ usePDFViewer.ts - Complete PDF state management
- ✅ App.tsx integration - End-to-end workflow from upload to display

**Testing Results:**
- ✅ Production build successful
- ✅ Development server operational (localhost:5173)
- ✅ All dependencies verified and functional
- ✅ TypeScript compilation without errors

### PDF.js Worker Version Compatibility Issue (August 17, 2025)
**Problem:** PDF viewer failing with "The API version '5.3.93' does not match the Worker version '5.4.54'"

**Root Cause:** Version mismatch between react-pdf v10.1.0 (uses PDF.js v5.3.93) and installed pdfjs-dist v5.4.54

**Solution Applied:**
- Fixed package.json: `"pdfjs-dist": "5.3.93"` (exact version match)
- Verified build success with proper worker bundling
- Development server confirmed working on localhost:5173

**Key Learning:** PDF.js requires exact version alignment between API and Worker components

**Status:** ✅ Resolved - Phase 3 implementation completed successfully

### Known Limitation: React-PDF CSS Imports
**Issue:** Vite build fails with react-pdf CSS imports for TextLayer and AnnotationLayer
**Impact:** Limited text selection and interactive PDF features
**Status:** Workaround applied - CSS imports removed for successful builds
**Future:** Consider alternative styling approach for enhanced PDF interaction
