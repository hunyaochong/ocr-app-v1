# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## AI Guidance

* To save main context space, for code searches, inspections, troubleshooting or analysis, use code-searcher subagent where appropriate - giving the subagent full context background for the task(s) you assign it.
* After receiving tool results, carefully reflect on their quality and determine optimal next steps before proceeding. Use your thinking to plan and iterate based on this new information, and then take the best next action.
* For maximum efficiency, whenever you need to perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially.
* Before you finish, please verify your solution
* Ensure each stop point or new feature utilizes the quality control agent.
* Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
* NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
* ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
* NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
* When you update or modify core context files, also update markdown documentation and memory bank
* When asked to commit changes, exclude CLAUDE.md and CLAUDE-*.md referenced memory bank system files from any commits. Never delete these files.

## Memory Bank System

This project uses a structured memory bank system with specialized context files. Always check these files for relevant information before starting work:

### Core Context Files

* **CLAUDE-troubleshooting.md** - Common issues and proven solutions (optimized)
* **CLAUDE-config-variables.md** - Configuration variables reference
* **archive/resolved-issues.md** - Historical troubleshooting cases (archived)

**Important:** Check these files for relevant information before starting work to understand the current system architecture and troubleshooting patterns.

### Memory Bank System Backups

When asked to backup Memory Bank System files, you will copy the core context files above and @.claude settings directory to directory @/path/to/backup-directory. If files already exist in the backup directory, you will overwrite them.

## Project Overview

OCR App v1 is a React-based web application that extracts text from PDF documents using advanced OCR technology. The application provides a side-by-side comparison view of the original PDF and extracted text.

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 19.1.1 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3.4.17 (downgraded from v4 for compatibility)
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui with Radix UI primitives
- **PDF Handling**: react-pdf with PDF.js 5.3.93
- **File Upload**: Custom FileUploadDialog (Grok-inspired design)
- **Export Integration**: Google Docs API with OAuth 2.0 (new feature)
- **OCR Backend**: n8n webhook hosted on Railway (Mistral AI OCR)
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **State Management**: React hooks (useState, useCallback, useRef)
- **API Integration**: Custom OCR API service with retry logic
- **Text Processing**: Advanced search with debouncing, regex caching, and highlighting
- **Component Architecture**: Modular design with focused subcomponents

### Component Architecture
- **TextOutput**: Modular container component (refactored from 268 to ~50 lines)
  - **TextHeader**: Controls (search toggle, copy button) with user feedback
  - **TextSearch**: Search input with navigation and results display
  - **TextDisplay**: Text rendering with ReactMarkdown and highlight support
  - **TextStats**: Word count, character count, and reading time statistics
- **Custom Hooks**: useTextSearch, useTextHighlighting, useOCRProcessing, usePDFViewer
- **Performance Optimizations**: LRU regex caching, debounced operations, safe iteration patterns

### Key Features
- PDF file upload with custom Grok-inspired modal interface (drag & drop)
- OCR text extraction via external API
- Split-pane comparison view (PDF vs extracted text)
- Resizable panels with collapse/expand functionality
- Progress tracking and error handling with retry mechanisms
- Text copying functionality
- Google Docs export with OAuth 2.0 authentication and folder selection
- Advanced text search with debounced input and regex pattern caching
- Real-time text highlighting with performance optimization
- Text statistics display (word count, character count, reading time)
- Modular component architecture for improved maintainability
- Resolved CSS styling issues (Tailwind v4 to v3 migration)

### Build Commands
- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production (runs TypeScript check + Vite build)
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build

### Current Project Status
- **Bundle Size**: ~890KB total (JS: 857KB, CSS: 33KB) - optimization needed for Phase 4
- **Recent Major Updates**: 
  - CSS styling system fixed (Tailwind v4 â†’ v3 migration)
  - Custom FileUploadDialog implemented (replaced FilePond)
  - Google Docs export feature added with OAuth 2.0
  - PDF dead white space issue resolved (August 19, 2025)
- **Development State**: Fully functional with resolved styling issues
- **Phase Status**: Phase 4 partially implemented (Google Docs export completed)
- **Architecture**: Fully modular with advanced text search and highlighting implemented
